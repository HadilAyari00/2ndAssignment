A report on the improvements made:

* Form with different fields to enter: A form has been added with various fields for the user to enter the game information. 

* Slight animation for the text inputs: A small animation has been added to the text inputs, which adds a visual element to the form and may improve the user experience.

* Updated table to match fields: The table has been updated to match the fields in the form, ensuring that the data entered is accurately reflected in the table.

* Added buttons that allow you to delete specific columns: buttons have been added that allow the user to delete specific columns from the table. This allows for greater flexibility in managing the data.

* Displaying game covers in rows: Game covers have been added to the rows in the table, providing a visual element and making it easier to identify specific games.

* Added the ability to search for each name: A search field has been added that allows the user to search for specific names. As the user types, the table will update accordingly, making it easier to find the desired game.

* Improved a bit on the CSS: The CSS has been slightly improved, which may enhance the overall appearance of the form and table.

* Added clickable header elements: The "Name of the Game", "Availability", "Publisher", "Category", and "Release Date" columns are now clickable and can be used to sort the table according to the selected column. This makes it easier for the user to organize and view the data.

* Added buttons to display games in pages: Buttons have been added that allow the user to navigate between pages and display the games in smaller groups. This may improve the user experience and make it easier to view a large amount of data. I have decreased the number of games displayed per page from 10 to 4 for easier accessibility during testing.

Overall, these improvements that have been implemented in a short period of time have added functionality and enhanced the user experience of the form and table. The added form fields, animation, and game covers add visual elements and make it easier for the user to enter and view data. The ability to delete specific columns, search for names, and sort the table according to different columns allows for greater control and organization of the data. The improved CSS and buttons for navigating between pages also contribute to a better user experience. :-)
